It's about a traditional way of living . 
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well . 
My mother suff@@ ered from nightmar@@ es all about the boat . 
Well I think it looks a bit like this . 
And I'm going to talk about HIV today , about the deaths , about the stigma . 
It eng@@ ages deep systems in our brain , in d@@ op@@ am@@ iner@@ gic systems that are there to make you chase sex , food and salt .

The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , " Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? " 
For example , through social media . 
They can have a preci@@ se idea of where they are , and sort of a v@@ ag@@ ue idea of where the other cars are . 
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one . 
It's also that we profoundly mis@@ understand Go@@ li@@ ath . 
But the potential of a connected car network is almost lim@@ it@@ less .

Fi@@ sh@@ net stock@@ ings . 
There's an enormous amount of anat@@ omical variation . 
Next , raising the money to fu@@ nd the procedure . 
That's aside . 
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these rec@@ ord@@ ings and asked , what was the retina seeing at that moment ? 
And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing , which is us@@ el@@ ess for a doctor like me trying to make a decision . 
My name is Joshua Wal@@ ters . 
I really mean life on Earth , past and present , from microbes to us humans , in its rich molecular diversity , the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that , collectively , biochemistry , life as a chemical process , as a chemical phenomenon . 
This is what really excites us .

That's what the spider has to interact with their environment . 
Now , in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies , the law has not greeted this S@@ ous@@ a revi@@ val with very much common sense . 
Well the good news is , we're looking for them . 
Now we talk about water wars . 
So what's going on when it doesn't ? 
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece . 
Now , what if we want to look at this more closely ? 
That's using a technology called OCR , for op@@ tical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there . 
Because it's very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it's a very silent road . 
Or maybe it was 31 and a qu@@ ar@@ ter percent . 
We expect more from technology and less from each other . 
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .

These are all over the planet Mars , and we're busy catalo@@ guing them now . 
Can't do much with them : Put them in your pocket . 
There's one more part to the story . 
That was why I put it as a single point up there . 
I went into a clean room with a fresh si@@ lic@@ on w@@ af@@ er , and then I just c@@ ranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
