So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here . 
That was a very moving piece . 
It uses we@@ dge and pe@@ g connections . 
So what we are doing is an acceler@@ ated evolution of sailing technology . 
Just take a moment and take a breath and think , what do you feel at this point ?

I'm here to talk about what we should do . 
He wanted to prevent the Ne@@ ti@@ zens [@@ from cri@@ tici@@ zing@@ ] him . 
Well , I actually don't think that's going to be the case . 
Because ultimately when you do that , you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more . 
But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non-@@ living end of this spectrum -- so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory , mixing together non@@ living ingredients to make new structures , and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems . 
When I organized my foundation , and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation , and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on . 
There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph .
