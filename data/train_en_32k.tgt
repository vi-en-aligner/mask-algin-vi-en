So it's very promising for making small computers . 
But you can end up hiding from each other , even as we're all constantly connected to each other . 
So the ideas and the narratives of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a come to your mind immediately . 
The engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .

Bo@@ y : What do you do all day ? 
Our answer , of course , was yes . 
We have to gradually increase the complexity . 
Look at this green spike in 196@@ 6 to a bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show . 
These are major issues . 
Every school succee@@ ds . 
And try that again and do that for another generation . 
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after . 
Sorry , this is a global story . 
A complicated question . 
This is our group , our main group of wea@@ vers . 
I can make my own purpose . 
How do we try to understand what China is ? 
What stops us from making them ?

And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it . 
They usually love their grandchildren , and are e@@ ag@@ er to spend time with them . 
And they weren't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air . 
When I was a student , the mortality rate was about 95 percent . 
So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .

They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from . 
These are some of the shots actually from my film . 
That's what we have discovered . 
They're over . 
But does it just happen over there ? 
And third , the meaningful life . 
So , what is the deal here ? 
They got together , and together they had the proof . 
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .

Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have . 
Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends . 
Well , we could protect very high-@@ value targets like clinics . 
S@@ ay a new super bug has emer@@ ged . 
What I want to talk about today is one idea .
